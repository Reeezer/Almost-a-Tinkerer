# Almost a Tinkerer

Almost a Tinkerer is a game taking inspiration from Shapez.io, Factorio, and Little Big Workshop. This game offers a unique and enjoyable experience for players.

The gameplay revolves around placing factories and conveyors on a grid to gather resources and transform them. The ultimate goal is to combine these resources to create furniture. As players progress through the storyline, they will unlock new buildings that are necessary for producing more complex products. Eventually, players will be able to deliver furniture to complete their objectives.

Almost a Tinkerer is designed to be a relaxing and immersive experience. It does not involve puzzle-solving elements and allows players the freedom to build and create as they please. Once the main storyline is completed, players unlock the final building, the splitter, which opens up opportunities for more intricate and elaborate builds. The game has no set endpoint, allowing players to create elaborate mazes of conveyors and factories to generate large quantities of furniture.

Almost a Tinkerer offers a delightful blend of strategy, creativity, and relaxation. Players can immerse themselves in the joy of building and designing their own manufacturing systems while enjoying the freedom to create and experiment without constraints.
